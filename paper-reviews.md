# Paper reviews

Reviews should address:

1. the main contributions of the paper(s),
2. the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, and
3. questions/discussion items you have based on the work.

Reviews should be a few paragraphs (in the style of a conference review, say for ACL or NeurIPS).
To provide further guidance, refer to the [ACL Reviewer Tutorial](https://aclrollingreview.org/reviewertutorial) and the [NeurIPS Reviewer Guidelines](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/Reviewer-Guidelines).

Reviews will be graded pass/fail and should be submitted by **11:00 AM PST on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/342794)** on the day of the lecture. 
For weeks when you are responsible for [paper discussions](https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2022/paper-discussions/), you will want to take additional time in thinking about questions/discussion items.
